# Foodify Project

Foodify is a  JavaScript web application that interacts with the [Forkify API](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/) to fetch and display recipe food data. This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as Webpack to bundle the modules. The user can search for a specific recipe, and save to a favorites list via local storage. The user can easily increase or decrease servings as per his need and can view detailed directions.


## Usage

* The Foodify  App allows users to search for recipes.
* Users can view the recipe along with the cook time and also increase or decrease the amount of servings they need.
* Bookmarked recipes are stored in local storage so no database was required for this application.
